My major is Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) consistently across my whole educational experience. I gained my Bachelor's degree at [Zhengzhou University](https://www.zzu.edu.cn/). I am currently a new PhD student at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) and my research focus might be on flow batteries. This website intends to record my academic achievements in the following years. I am naive in the research field, so I will feel extremely glad to receive messages from you about flow batteries. Therefore, feel free to contact me, if you like doing so, by email: yklian430@outlook.com or e1142406@u.nus.edu.
