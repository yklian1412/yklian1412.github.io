collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: 
excerpt: 'Nonprecious metal catalysts, particularly M−N−C catalysts, are widely recognized as promising contenders for
the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, a notable performance gap persists between M−N−C catalysts and Pt-based catalysts under acidic conditions.'
